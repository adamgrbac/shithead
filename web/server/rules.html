	<h1> Rules for Shithead</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The first player to have no cards wins.</li>
		<li>A player may only play from their lowest row of cards i.e. if they have cards in their hand, they may not place from their 3 face-up cards</li>
		<li>To play a card, it must be equal or higher than the previous card, unless other rules below apply.</li>
		<li>You may play multiple cards of the same value in one turn e.g 6H & 6D.</li>
		<li>If 4 cards of the same value are played consecutively, the player of the final card discards the pile and plays again</li>
		<li>2 - Reset: If a 2 is played, the next player may play whatever card they like. A 2 may be played on any card.</li>
		<li>3 - Glass: If a 3 is played, the next player must play to whatever the card was underneath the 3 i.e. 3 on a 5 means the next player plays according to the 5. A 3 may be played on any card</li>
		<li>5H - Swap Hands: If the 5 of Hearts is played, all players pass their hand to the next player, in the direction of play</li>
		<li>7 - Under: If a 7 is played, the player must play a card with a value equal to or below a 7 i.e. 2,3,4,5,6,7. A 7 may also be played on an 8 or a 9</li>
		<li>8 - Reverse: If an 8 is played, the direction of play is reversed. Playing multiple 8's stacks the effect i.e. 2x 8s continue the same direction.
			<ul>
				<li><strong>N.B. In a 2-player game, 8s skip the other player.</strong></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>10 - Burn: If a 10 is played, the current discard pile is removed from the game, and the player plays again. A 10 may be played on any card except a 7.</li>		
	</ul>
	
	<h1>How to Play</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>When 2 or more players arrive in the lobby, a blue button will appear, which can be clicked to start a game.
			<ul>
				<li><strong>N.B. Any players arriving after a game has start will be placed in a queue until the game is won or restarted</strong></li>
			</ul>

		<li>Before the game commences, a player may swap cards from the hand (bottom row of cards) to their face-up cards (middle row of cards). To do so, they must click the cards they want to swap (so they appear in the bottom-right section of the screen), and then click the "Swap cards" button</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>N.B. A player doesn't have to swap the cards evenly i.e. 2-for-1, however they won't be able to continue until their hand and face-up cards hold 3 cards each.</strong></li>
			</ul>
